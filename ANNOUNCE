ANNOUNCEMENT: HTML::Template::Expr 0.07

CHANGES

    - Added support for ESCAPE attribute in combination with EXPR.
      (Michael Peters)

    - Fixed a bug where functions which returned 0 or more than one
      return value would cause a stack under or overflow.  Functions
      are now called in scalar context, eliminating the problem.
      Thanks to Jamie Krasnoo for the spot.

DESCRIPTION

This module provides an extension to HTML::Template which allows
expressions in the template syntax.  This is purely an addition - all
the normal HTML::Template options, syntax and behaviors will still
work.

Expression support includes comparisons, math operations, string
operations and a mechanism to allow you add your own functions at
runtime.
