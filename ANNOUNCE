ANNOUNCEMENT: HTML::Template::Expr 0.02

CHANGES

- Fixed bug where numeric functions all returned 1. 
  (reported by Peter Leonard)

- Improved performance over 300% with a new grammar and expression evaluator.

- Enhanced grammar to support call(foo > 10) syntax.


DESCRIPTION

This module provides an extension to HTML::Template which allows
expressions in the template syntax.  This is purely an addition - all
the normal HTML::Template options, syntax and behaviors will still
work.

Expression support includes comparisons, math operations, string
operations and a mechanism to allow you add your own functions at
runtime.
